        <br>
        <p>Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is reluctant to face each other and opting for a non-face-to-face because of risks of epidemics. Therefore, new IT technologies are emerging to overcome this, and actual usage of IT technologies is increasing. However, seniors who are experiencing various inconveniences in using these new technologies spend more time and money in real life than other generations. In the worst case, seniors cannot use new technologies. In this situation, our team captured that despite the large population of the elderly generation, there is no business to improve the problem, and that will continue even if Corona ends. Our team thought the hackathon that presented this topic was a great opportunity, and all the team members unanimously chose the theme of Senior.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>Later, our team held a meeting to narrow down the scope of the new technology. However, it has rarely narrowed down to too wide a range of new technologies. At this time, our team came to think about whether there is a way to include all new technologies rather than narrow them down. As a result, there was an opinion that all new technologies should be included, but various experts who will teach the new technology should be found and matched 1:1 with the elderly. IT does not treat people, but people treat people. If possible, artificial intelligence such as humans would be good. It makes it easier and more friendly for the elderly to learn new technologies from a human perspective. It also had the advantage of being able to actively solve personal difficulties because it is a 1:1 match. As will be explained later, matched experts will be given financial benefits or lectures, such as Ad systems and special lectures on new technology experiences. Our team hopes that seniors who use our business will be familiar with the word Technology, and will be a new generation of cool seniors who can say, " Itâ€™s a piece of cake.".</p>
